## What is it?
This simple converter app can take in multiple individual .png or .jpg files and convert them over to individual .pdf files.

### How to use
Simply grab a release from the release tab and open the portable exe. As of version 0.1, you can convert .png and .jpg files to multiple .pdf files. You can also configure where the pdfs are output to in settings.

### Why?
I'm tired of professors making me take individual pictures of each homework assignment question (mostly math) and making me individually convert them to pdfs and individually upload them online. Gone are those days.
